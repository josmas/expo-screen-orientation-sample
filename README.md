# Expo sample app for screen orientation and navigation
After installing dependencies `expo start` to run on web or devices.

## Features
Uses react navigation (only two tabs for now) and expo-screen-orientation to fix screen orientation for each of the tabs.
The change happens using the focus hook from react navigation (on screen focus)

More to come... most likely.
